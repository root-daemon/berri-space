# Frontend Rules
- Use functional components with TypeScript.
- Fetch data using server actions or Supabase client.
- Never expose direct file URLs; use signed URLs.
- Use Tailwind CSS and consistent spacing scales.
- Maintain accessibility (aria labels, keyboard focus).
- Use Clerk session for authenticated UI states.
